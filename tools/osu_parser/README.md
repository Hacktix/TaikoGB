# Osu! Taiko map to TaikoGB map converter
This script converts Osu! Taiko maps to TaikoGB format.

## Usage
`python parser.py path/to/map`

You can also use just the map name if you are working from the same directory as the parser and copy the Osu! map over to the same folder.

The script outputs the ready-to-use TaikoGB map to the same place as the previous Osu! format map with `.tgb` added to the end.

## Warning!
This script has only been tested on one map! Please open an issue ASAP if any problems arise!
